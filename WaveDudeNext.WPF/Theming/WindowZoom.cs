/// XAML read, the content in place, nothing shown yet), and again whenever the setting changes, the window's content
/// gets a layout scale by the zoom and Ideal text formatting (the theme's Display formatting rasterises glyphs on the
/// 100 % grid, and WPF scales those bitmaps through a transform, soft; 2026-11-01, seen in a capture), and the window's
/// explicit sizes, Width, Height and the minimum and maximum, each when set and finite, are multiplied by the change
/// of zoom (a bound size, the main window's, carries the zoom from <see cref="Converters.ZoomConverter"/> when the
/// XAML is read and is set like the others after a change); a dimension sized to content follows the content. The
/// window is then kept inside its monitor's work area (<see cref="KeepOnScreen"/>, the user's rule), shrunk to it when
/// larger.
/// <para>
/// Whole pixels at any factor (the user's rule: a line is there or not, 1 or 2 pixels wide, never cut): WPF rounds
/// its layout to the DPI it believes its tree has and knows nothing of a transform, so a window's tree is told the
/// monitor's DPI times the zoom (<see cref="VisualTreeHelper.SetRootDpi"/>, meant for this; a system-DPI-aware process
/// never resets it), which puts every rounded size and offset under the transform on a device pixel, while the window
/// itself and its chrome, outside the transform, round to nothing and keep the client area's whole real pixels.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The process is DPI aware per monitor (the manifest, 2026-11-02, the user's choice): WPF then gives every new visual
/// its parent's DPI (its AddVisualChild does so in that mode alone), puts the monitor's DPI on a tree when a window's
/// handle takes it as its root, and again when the window lands on a monitor of another scale; the zoomed DPI is put
/// back after each (the window's source change, its DpiChanged event). A popup is a tree of its own, WPF's PopupRoot,
/// given a window on the monitor's DPI at each opening, and it must be told the zoomed DPI before its first drawing:
/// a Border builds the pens of its edges once, at the first drawing, for the DPI it sees then (the user's report: a
/// tooltip's edge 1.5 px wide, a half-transparent line beside the fill). So the popup's content is watched for the
/// source it gets at each opening, which comes before any layout or drawing: the theme's own popups (menus,
/// drop-downs, the colour button) through <see cref="PopupProperty"/> on the popup, a tooltip or context menu, the
/// content of a parentless popup of WPF's own that takes no transform from its target (Popup.UpdateTransform in WPF's
/// source), through <see cref="StandaloneProperty"/> in its style, whose other setters give it the scale and the
/// formatting bound to the setting.
