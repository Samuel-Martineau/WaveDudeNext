/// Paints the enabled <see cref="OpticalPart"/>s of a project into the red channel of the scene pixels, the
/// channel the engines read as the refractive index (red = index × 100; red 0 is a mirror, see
/// <see cref="Engine.SceneData.MirrorRefractiveIndex"/>), and an absorbing part's absorption into the blue channel
/// (damping, see <see cref="PaintAbsorption"/>). Green (image sources) is never touched. Parts are painted in list
/// order, a later one's index over an earlier one's. Refractive parts are supersampled
/// 4 × 4 per pixel and the sample indices averaged, a sample outside the part counting the pixel's existing index
/// (red 0 as 1), which is also the medium a graded coating band rises from (<see cref="CoatedPart"/>); a mirror part
/// tests the pixel centre alone and writes red 0, since an averaged mirror edge would
/// clamp to glass. Only pixels near an edge (the outline, the coating band's inner edge, a Bragg layer) are
/// supersampled: the shape's depth at the pixel centre is an exact distance, so a pixel farther than a sample's
/// reach from every edge takes its centre's index in one go (2026-10-19, a drag of a part was sluggish). And where the
/// shape's depths are distances (<see cref="PartShape.DepthIsDistance"/>), one pixel centre settles a run of the pixels
/// after it along the row (<see cref="Settled"/>): a centre k pixels on is at most k nearer to every edge, so the pixels
/// within the nearest edge's distance less the reach are outside too, or body too, and only the body index is asked of
/// them (2026-11-04: a box of 600 pixels a row takes a handful of depth evaluations instead of 600; proven byte for byte
/// against the pixel-by-pixel painting by <c>library_check</c>).
